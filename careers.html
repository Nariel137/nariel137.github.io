    <h1>Careers</h1>
    <p class="major">
      In this section, you can learn about the careers of people who used to
      work at CERN but left academia for something else. Itâ€™s quite interesting
      to hear their reasons for leaving academia, the role CERN played in
      getting the new job, the main differences between the jobs, and all the
      ways one can apply knowledge and experiences gained in the research
      environment.  Personally, talking to them opened my eyes to the myriad of
      career options and possibilities that are just waiting for us. Maybe
      their stories will do the same for you.

She never thought she would work at CERN. Actually, she never thought she would study physics, at all.</p>
