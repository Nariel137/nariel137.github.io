      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My friend, after hearing how many students come to me with questions regarding CERN, got the idea of this blog. He suggested that many more people could benefit this way; simply by turning my answers into a few posts.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what I did! I answer questions about <a href="./cern.html">CERN</a> applications, motivation letters, and what to do once you are accepted to their program. In addition, I added stories about <a href="./people.html">people</a> at CERN and the <a href="./career.html">career</a> paths of those who left the field. I truly hope you will love it and find it inspiring, motivating and helpful.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the most beautiful things about CERN is a huge diversity in culture, mentality, and nationalities. In the <a href="./culture.html">culture</a> section of the blog, CERN employees are answering the same group of questions showing us that maybe we are not that different after all.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t wait to share with you all the things I prepared for you, but first I do have one request:</p>
<p>Please, keep in mind that everything here is done in my free time for the sole purpose of helping you. I would appreciate it so much if we could be kind, helpful and nice to each other. If you find some of the information to be incorrect or if you disagree with something, please let me know. I will be more than happy to make any necessary changes to make these posts the best possible for you.</p>
<p>So let’s help each other and only spread positivity on this blog.</p>
<p>Thank you and May the force be with you,</p>
<p>Milena</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am writing all the posts from my personal experience only, with no collaboration with CERN. While I certainly try to be as diligent as humanely possible, I can not guarantee their correctness. As usual with advice, take it with a grain of salt ;)</em></p>
