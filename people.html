    <h1>People</h1>
    <p class="major">
      There are many scientists at CERN whose brilliance and work go way beyond
      their research. They are people who will leave you speechless and
      inspired after just one conversation. They are people who never really
      let go of that curious, artistic, adventurous child we all used to be, a
      few that "keep adventuring and never grow up". And those few are
      people these stories are about.

        <p><p>Thomas has always been a storyteller. Ever since he was a young boy, he has been creating stories and worlds where anything is possible. One of those worlds he shares with us in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2PbZnkq">ManaNet</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="./people/2019-01-22-philip.html">I want to become an astronaut</a></h2>
        
        <p><p>Working at CERN is a truly wonderful experience and for many a dream come true.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, there are many advantages to being part of CERN. My personal favourites are the exciting challenges, the fact you are creating knowledge on a daily basis and brilliant people you are surrounded with.</p>
<p>Of course, like in any other job, working at CERN also comes with itâ€™s fair share of challenges. In such moments what you need is a relatable person who also has many stories which can keep you distracted for a while. Thankfully, at CERN you can easily find such people and sometimes, if you are lucky enough, your chosen person turns out to be someone who wants to become an astronaut.</p>
